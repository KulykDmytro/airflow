Package apache-airflow-providers-ftp
------------------------------------------------------

`File Transfer Protocol (FTP) <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc114>`__

Release: 3.3.1

Provider package
----------------

This is a provider package for ``ftp`` provider. All classes for this provider package
are in ``airflow.providers.ftp`` python package.

Installation
------------

You can install this package on top of an existing Airflow 2 installation (see ``Requirements`` below)
for the minimum Airflow version supported) via
``pip install apache-airflow-providers-ftp``

Requirements
------------

The minimum Apache Airflow version supported by this provider package is ``2.4.0``.

This provider package is preinstalled by default when Apache Airflow is installed. You do not need to
install it separately. You can upgrade and downgrade it independently of Apache Airflow package though.

.. note::

    The minimum Apache Airflow version for this package is 2.4.0 and it will fail
    import at runtime if the version of Airflow is lower even if there is no requirement specified in
    the dependencies - this is because the provider is preinstalled and specifying minimum Apache
    Airflow version would create a dependency cycle, which confuses dependency tools.
